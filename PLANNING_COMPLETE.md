- **Automatic Rejections**: 60% (tests) + 40% (language) + bugs + impression

### After Phase 1 Completion
- **Portfolio Score**: 7.0/10 (+3.4)
- **Interview Callback**: 40-50% (+30-35 points)
- **Automatic Rejections**: Eliminated

### After Phase 2 Completion

## How to Execute

### Step 1: Start Phase 1 Now
```
1. Open specs/001-phase1-critical-fixes/tasks.md
2. Start with Task T001 (install Vitest)
3. Follow task sequence, checking off as you complete
4. Stop at phase checkpoints to verify
5. Total time: 16.5 hours
```

### Step 2: Execute Phase 1 (While working)
- Takes ~16.5 hours spread across days/weeks
- You have detailed checklist - no surprises
- Each task has specific file paths and acceptance criteria

### Step 3: Plan Phase 2 Execution
- After Phase 1 completes, I can generate Phase 2 task list
- Or generate it now if you want visibility into full roadmap
- Phase 2 can start immediately after Phase 1

### Step 4: Execute Phase 2 (After Phase 1)
- Takes ~10-16 hours depending on blog features
- CI/CD is critical path (3-4 hours)
- TypeScript and Performance can be parallel
- Blog features are optional (4-6 hours)

## Decision Points

### Should I start Phase 1 now?
**YES** - You have a complete checklist with 47 specific tasks. Just open `specs/001-phase1-critical-fixes/tasks.md` and start T001.

### Should I generate Phase 2 task list now?
**OPTIONAL** - I can generate it after you approve the Phase 2 plan. Gives you full roadmap visibility but adds ~15 min now.

### Can I execute Phase 1 and Phase 2 in parallel?
**NOT RECOMMENDED** - Phase 1 must complete and tests pass before Phase 2 CI/CD will work. Sequential is safer.

### What if Phase 1 takes longer than 16.5 hours?
**NO PROBLEM** - That's why you have detailed tasks. If you hit blockers, ask for help. You'll learn and improve for Phase 2.

### Can I skip Phase 2 blog features?
**YES** - They're P2 (nice-to-have). CI/CD + TypeScript are critical P1. Skip blog features if time is tight.
