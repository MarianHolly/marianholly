<!DOCTYPE html>
<html>
  <head>
    <title>My Vue.js App</title>
  </head>
  <body>
    <div id="app">
      <h1>{{ message }}</h1>
      <button @click="count++">Increment</button>
    </div>

    <script src="https://unpkg.com/vue@3/dist/vue.global.js"></script>
    <script>
      const app = Vue.createApp({
        data() {
          return {
            message: 'Hello Vue.js!',
            count: 0,
          };
        },
      });

      app.mount('#app');
    </script>
  </body>

          return {
            message: 'Hello Vue.js!',
            count: 0,
          };
        },
        methods: {
          increment() {
            this.count++;
          },
        },
