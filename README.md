### About Me
I am a dedicated developer currently pursuing a degree in **Applied Informatics at the University of Ss. Cyril and Methodius in Trnava**. My journey into tech is fueled by a transition from a high-precision background in Dental Technology, which has instilled in me a meticulous eye for detail and a structured approach to problem-solving.

I am a **self-taught Frontend specialist** who has evolved into a **certified Python/Full-Stack Developer**. I enjoy building clean, performant web applications and I am increasingly drawn to the analytical side of development, specifically SQL optimization and data processing.

* **Education:** University of Ss. Cyril and Methodius (Applied Informatics)
* **Professional Goal:** To secure a Junior role where I can grow my skills while contributing to data-driven or AI-integrated solutions.
* **Adaptability:** Ready to excel as a **Junior Developer**, **QA Tester**, or **Data Analyst**.
* **Location:** Slovakia (Open to Remote / Hybrid / On-site in TT, BA, and surroundings)
