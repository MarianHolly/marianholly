## What are Core Web Vitals?

Core Web Vitals are a set of metrics that measure real-world user experience:
- **LCP (Largest Contentful Paint)**: Loading performance
- **FID (First Input Delay)**: Interactivity
- **CLS (Cumulative Layout Shift)**: Visual stability

---

## Current Metrics

### Largest Contentful Paint (LCP)
**Measures**: Loading performance
**Target**: < 2.5 seconds

| Device | Value | Status |
|--------|-------|--------|
| Desktop | [VALUE]s | [PASS/NEEDS IMPROVEMENT/POOR] |
| Mobile | [VALUE]s | [PASS/NEEDS IMPROVEMENT/POOR] |

**Analysis**: [Brief explanation of what loads as LCP element]

### First Input Delay (FID)
**Measures**: Interactivity
**Target**: < 100 milliseconds

| Device | Value | Status |
|--------|-------|--------|
| Desktop | [VALUE]ms | [PASS/NEEDS IMPROVEMENT/POOR] |
| Mobile | [VALUE]ms | [PASS/NEEDS IMPROVEMENT/POOR] |

**Analysis**: [Brief explanation of interactivity performance]

---

### Cumulative Layout Shift (CLS)
**Measures**: Visual stability
**Target**: < 0.1

| Device | Value | Status |
|--------|-------|--------|
| Desktop | [VALUE] | [PASS/NEEDS IMPROVEMENT/POOR] |
| Mobile | [VALUE] | [PASS/NEEDS IMPROVEMENT/POOR] |

**Analysis**: [Brief explanation of layout stability]

## Summary

| Metric | Desktop | Mobile | Overall Status |
|--------|---------|--------|----------------|
| LCP | [VALUE]s | [VALUE]s | ✅/⚠️/❌ |
| FID | [VALUE]ms | [VALUE]ms | ✅/⚠️/❌ |
| CLS | [VALUE] | [VALUE] | ✅/⚠️/❌ |

**Overall Assessment**: [All passing / Needs improvement / Poor]
